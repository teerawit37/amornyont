            "paragraph1": "Use wide color to enhance the visual experience on compatible displays. Wide color displays support a P3 color space, which can produce richer, more saturated colors than sRGB. As a result, photos and videos that use wide color are more lifelike, and visual data and status indicators that use wide color are more impactful. When appropriate, use the Display P3 color profile at 16 bits per pixel (per channel) and export images in PNG format. Note that a wide color display is needed to design wide color images and select P3 colors.",
            "paragraph2": "Provide color space-specific image and color variations when the experience calls for it. In general, P3 colors and images tend to appear as expected on sRGB devices. Occasionally, however, it may be hard to differentiate between two very similar P3 colors when they’re viewed in sRGB. Gradients that use colors in the P3 spectrum can also sometimes appear clipped on sRGB devices. To avoid these issues, you can provide distinct images and colors in the asset catalog of your Xcode project to ensure visual fidelity on both wide color and sRGB devices.",
